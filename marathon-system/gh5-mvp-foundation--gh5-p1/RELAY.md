# GH-5 Phase 1 — Shared local operation

Umbrella/member: https://github.com/HiQS-Labs/XYZ-layout-engine/issues/5
Canonical plan: PROJECT/2-WORKING/GH-5-MVP-FOUNDATION.md, Phase 1.
Order: gh5-p1, depends on nothing; strictly serial.
Builder: Agy. Reviewer: independent Codex. No fallback, no push/merge/issue close.

## Scope

Extract reusable backend operations with a direct-execution guard; importing them must not run the experiment. Keep the legacy experiment's bytes/geometry and product-hero smoke unchanged. Put trusted nutrition composition behind one versioned recipe. Keep plain ESM and existing pinned dependencies; no plugin registry, monorepo or provider client.
Normalize the local library/CLI request/result against PRD semantics in tools/request.mjs. Reject unknown fields, unsupported formats/backend/fallback, invalid dimensions/scale and missing input with field-level errors. Ship only an honest local supported subset; document unsupported remote fields rather than accepting them silently. Result includes normalized input, recipe/backend versions, validation report, provenance and output digests.
Use fileURLToPath and realpath/root containment for inputs/output, including symlink escape rejection; reject remote/file references in supplied SVG, scripts/foreignObject and nested SVG+embedded raster on the supported Satori path unless explicitly normalized with proven visibility. Bound encoded bytes, decoded dimensions/pixels and total render area before decoder/layout allocation. Use existing resvg for admitted SVG/raster inspection, not a new parser dependency; never claim a regex blacklist alone makes arbitrary SVG safe. Limit to trusted bundled SVG and validated direct PNG for v1 if safe general SVG admission is uncertain.
Default to lazy Satori/resvg only. Load/launch Chromium solely for explicit comparison or recipe-declared capability; preserve finally cleanup. Stage one run under a unique same-filesystem directory; validate all requested artifacts before atomic last-good manifest publication. Do not replace a last-good deliverable on failure; preserve bounded diagnostic state and remove orphan staging files safely. Existing spike evidence is read-only.
Extend C1 within its existing test block: import no-side-effect assertion, CLI in a space-containing temp path, invalid request/escaping symlink and injected failed publication preserving prior digests. C2 retains legacy geometry/digests. Run pnpm test. Record actual commands/results in tools/MVP-REPORT.md.

## Boundaries and proof

Use ponytail: stdlib/platform/pinned deps first, minimal shared modules, no wrappers/frameworks/queue/provider client/CI/new test blocks. You are not alone in the codebase: preserve predecessor/other-agent edits, never revert unrelated work. Follow ROUTER/AGENTS startup. Read the exact phase in the canonical plan and source recon before editing. Write ONLY the YAML artifact paths and the harness relay. The plan/briefs, releases.db/sql, test-budget.json, committed spike output and originals are read-only. Delete copied runtime only in Phase 2 after replacement proof. Put temporary files under OS temp/ignored output; never off-allowlist scratch in the repo.

Do not execute the pre-advance `pnpm test` yourself during builder flight (installed driver contract); the driver owns that gate. Extend the existing assertions for the named failure modes and record focused non-mutating inspections or temp-only commands in tools/MVP-REPORT.md. Reviewer must check their semantics and the driver must run the full existing gate before phase.approved. No live paid calls; use a deterministic temporary caller stub for generation. No fabricated human acceptance/provider measurements. If a scope requirement cannot be delivered, emit FAIL/PARKED with evidence, do not mark it complete or quietly shrink it.

Every loop is bounded: 10 fit attempts, explicit generation/call deadlines/caps, 2 review rounds, turn cap 1500s. Easy rollback via phase revert plus last-good manifest; preserve input/provenance and unknown paid outcomes. Use the debug-mantra skill to reproduce/trace/falsify concrete failures; never use --force.

## Receipt contract

Append the required native build/review block. Final block uses literal `VERDICT: PASS`, `VERDICT: FAIL` or `VERDICT: PARKED` and a nonempty `Basis:`; put conversational approval in `Review outcome:`. Only independent reviewer can approve. Follow native tick handoff/terminal protocol exactly; no builder may set Approved or self-attest. Future human artwork approval remains pending.

▶ TAKE YOUR TURN (agy — BUILDER role)

You are the BUILDER for this phase. Read the phase brief above and implement it.
APPEND-ONLY FILE (GH-529 attestation): add your block at the END and never delete, reorder, or rewrite any existing content — the terminal attestation refuses the approval if any byte above your block changed, even a tidy-up.
1. Implement the brief by creating/editing the artifact file(s): tools/spike/render.mjs, tools/spike/assets.mjs, tools/spike/scene.mjs, tools/render.mjs, tools/request.mjs, tools/recipes/nutrition.mjs, package.json, tools/spike/test/canaries.test.mjs, CHANGELOG.md, tools/MVP-REPORT.md
2. Append a build block to this relay file: `### Round N · Builder · agy` summarizing what you did (files touched, key decisions).
3. Use this exact tick binary (run it from any directory): /Users/noelsaw/marathon-clones/marathon-gh-5-mvp-foundation/.xyz/bin/tick
   - /Users/noelsaw/marathon-clones/marathon-gh-5-mvp-foundation/.xyz/bin/tick claim MARATHON-GH5-P1-TURN --agent agy --paths "marathon-system/gh5-mvp-foundation--gh5-p1/RELAY.md,tools/spike/render.mjs, tools/spike/assets.mjs, tools/spike/scene.mjs, tools/render.mjs, tools/request.mjs, tools/recipes/nutrition.mjs, package.json, tools/spike/test/canaries.test.mjs, CHANGELOG.md, tools/MVP-REPORT.md"
   - /Users/noelsaw/marathon-clones/marathon-gh-5-mvp-foundation/.xyz/bin/tick ping MARATHON-GH5-P1-TURN --agent agy
   - /Users/noelsaw/marathon-clones/marathon-gh-5-mvp-foundation/.xyz/bin/tick release MARATHON-GH5-P1-TURN --agent agy --to codex
4. Edit ONLY these paths: marathon-system/gh5-mvp-foundation--gh5-p1/RELAY.md and tools/spike/render.mjs, tools/spike/assets.mjs, tools/spike/scene.mjs, tools/render.mjs, tools/request.mjs, tools/recipes/nutrition.mjs, package.json, tools/spike/test/canaries.test.mjs, CHANGELOG.md, tools/MVP-REPORT.md. Do NOT run git. Do NOT touch any other file — the harness commits for you.
5. HAND OFF EXPLICITLY (GH-268): after releasing the token, end your turn by naming who acts next —
   "handing off to codex — codex, take your turn." A turn that ends without that line
   leaves a human guessing whether the relay is waiting on them or has stalled. Do this EVERY round,
   not just the first. ALSO, you MUST update the `NEXT:` line at the top of this file to exactly: `NEXT: codex (Reviewer)`

---

▶ TAKE YOUR TURN (codex — REVIEWER role)

You are the REVIEWER for this phase. Read the latest builder block above AND review the artifact file(s) on disk: tools/spike/render.mjs, tools/spike/assets.mjs, tools/spike/scene.mjs, tools/render.mjs, tools/request.mjs, tools/recipes/nutrition.mjs, package.json, tools/spike/test/canaries.test.mjs, CHANGELOG.md, tools/MVP-REPORT.md. REVIEW THE WHOLE FILE, NOT JUST THE DIFF (GH-268): a beta test had this loop reach 'Approved' in two rounds while an independent audit of the same branch found 20 issues (1 critical, 4 high) — every one of them in the pre-existing code the change sat on, which nobody had read. Pre-existing defects in a file you are touching are IN SCOPE; say so explicitly if you find none. DECLARE IT: your review block MUST contain a literal 'swept file: yes' or 'swept file: no' line — without it a reviewer that skipped the sweep is indistinguishable in the transcript from one that did it and found nothing, which is exactly how those 20 issues stayed invisible.
APPEND-ONLY FILE (GH-529 attestation): add your block at the END and never delete, reorder, or rewrite any existing content — the terminal attestation refuses the approval if any byte above your block changed, even a tidy-up.
1. Append a review block: `### Round N · Reviewer · codex` followed by your assessment.
2. If changes needed: add `**Verdict:** Changes requested`, update the `NEXT:` line to exactly `NEXT: agy (Builder)`, then: /Users/noelsaw/marathon-clones/marathon-gh-5-mvp-foundation/.xyz/bin/tick release MARATHON-GH5-P1-TURN --agent codex --to agy
3. If satisfied: add `**Verdict:** Approved`, set `STATUS: Approved`, then: /Users/noelsaw/marathon-clones/marathon-gh-5-mvp-foundation/.xyz/bin/tick done MARATHON-GH5-P1-TURN --agent codex
4. Use this exact tick binary (run it from any directory) for all token operations: /Users/noelsaw/marathon-clones/marathon-gh-5-mvp-foundation/.xyz/bin/tick
   Edit ONLY marathon-system/gh5-mvp-foundation--gh5-p1/RELAY.md (your review block + STATUS). Do NOT edit the artifact yourself — request changes instead. Do NOT run git.
4b. TO VERIFY A FINDING, WRITE PROBE FILES OUTSIDE THE REPO — under $TMPDIR, never inside the
   working tree. Creating even one scratch file in the repo is an off-lane write: containment
   reverts it and FAILS YOUR WHOLE TURN, discarding the review you just did (GH-441). Observed
   2026-08-08: a reviewer found a real latent crash, wrote two probe files in-tree to demonstrate
   it, and lost the turn for doing so — the finding survived only because RELAY.md happens to be
   on your allowlist. `cp` what you need to "$TMPDIR/probe.$$/" and work there instead. Verifying
   is wanted; verifying in-tree is what costs you the turn.
4c. A finding that asks for a behaviour change is a generalization unless you can paste the concrete
   input — a row, a value, a `file:line` — that fails under the current code (GH-681). Every
   `[Blocker]` or `[Should]` requesting a behaviour change MUST carry `Observed input:`,
   `Affected scope:` and `Falsifier:` lines; a `[Blocker]` must cite an observed failure. The Builder
   may disposition a request lacking these as `Declined — unproven generalization`.
5. HAND OFF EXPLICITLY (GH-268): end your turn by naming who acts next — "handing off to agy —
   agy, take your turn" when requesting changes, or "relay closed, no further turn needed" when
   approving. The beta report singled this out: the Reviewer turn did not tell the user to go back to the
   Producer, so the relay looked stalled when it was simply waiting. Do this EVERY round.
